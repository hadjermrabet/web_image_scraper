 web scraper made in python for downloading/scraping all public available images from a given website.

How it works 
----------------
Once you specify the website, the scraper will scans through out a given website to find all public available links and dive into all of those to find if there is any downloadable image , If there is , it will automatically download it and save on your local directory.



Dependancies
---------------
Before you begin playing this project, I recommend you to install the following dependencies first

```bash
$-> pip install bs4, requests, pillow
-----------------------------
Now once you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a url for a specific website you would like to scrap the images from  and then once done,  wait for the images to be downloaded.
